# Lab4 Roster without Conflicts

## Description
Recode the roster example we studied in class such that it drops the students who are 
concurrently enrolled in CS4 and any other class. That is, the student's name should be printed if 
she is either in any of the classes besides CS4 or in CS4 alone.
