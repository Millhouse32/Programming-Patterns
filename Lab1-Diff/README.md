# Lab 1 Diff

## Overview:
Diff. Implement a program that compares two text files character-by-character. The program should output the line numbers that contain different characters and the place where the two lines start to differ (the difference is denoted by ^ (caret) character. 

## Credits:
Work completed by Nicholas Miller

## Use:
I have also subbmited a Makefile for ease of use

#Commands:
"make" - compiles the program using the clang++ compiler and outputs the executable 'diff'

'make run filename1 filename2' will execute ./diff filename1 filename2

'make clean' will remove the executable
